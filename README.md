Capital One SES 2016 Hackathon

At the end of the 2016 Capital One Software Engineering Summit, we participated in a  group hackathon and presentation to Capital One leadership. The prompt was to get find a way to promote online banking in demographics that are underrepresented or tend to avoid online banking. Our group of five decided to tackle the oldest demographic (50+ years old) and worked to integrate Capital One's Alexa Skill with a hardware-LED setup to handle visible reminders of simple banking tasks, which would encourage them to utilize online banking in a way where they don't have to give up full control over their account to automation and Alexa.
